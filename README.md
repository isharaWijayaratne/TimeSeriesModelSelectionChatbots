# **Chatbot Guided Selection of Time Series Forecasting Models**
---

During my undergraduate research, I developed a GPT-based chatbot designed to interpret time series characteristics expressed in natural language and recommend the most suitable forecasting model. To enhance accuracy and usability, I created two specialized chatbots—one tailored for yearly data and another for monthly data—ensuring optimal performance across different time series frequencies. Leveraging cutting-edge tools from OpenAI and LangChain, I engineered a seamless, intelligent system capable of bridging the gap between statistical modeling and user-friendly AI-driven interaction.
